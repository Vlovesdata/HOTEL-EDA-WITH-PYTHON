# HOTEL EDA WITH PYTHON
This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover trends, preferences, and key metrics that affect the hospitality industry. The analysis focuses on two hotels in Algarve, Portugal: Pine Cliffs Hotel and 3HB Faro.

# üìä Project Overview
The project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to answer key questions, such as:
- Which hotel type is most preferred?
- Which agent made the most bookings?
- Which country contributes the highest number of guests?

Key findings include:
- The most bookings were made by Agent ID 9 (2015‚Äì2017).
- City hotels are more popular than luxury resorts.
- Most guests come from Portugal, the UK, and France.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
